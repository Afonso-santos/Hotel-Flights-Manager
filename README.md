# Projeto LI3

## Grade: XX/20 ‚≠êÔ∏è

An [glib](https://docs.gtk.org/glib/) and [ncurses](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/) based project, made for
our [LI3](https://www4.di.uminho.pt/~jno/sitedi/uc_J303N1.html) class. 

Project requirements (set by the professors) are in `Requirements.pdf` (üáµüáπ).

## Building

### Dependencies

- GNU Make (build-time)
- GCC (build-time)
- Bash (build-time)
- Doxygen (optional, build-time)
- glib
- ncurses

Note that the only supported platform is **Linux** (others \*NIX systems _may_ work) and the only
supported compiler is GCC (clang _may_ work).

### Building

A release build is achieved with:

```bash
$ make
```

To perform a debug build (no optimizations, debug symbols enabled):

```bash
$ DEBUG=1 make
```

To generate documentation (Doxygen is required):

```bash
$ make docs
```

To remove files generated by a build, run:

```bash
$ make clean
```

## Running

```bash
